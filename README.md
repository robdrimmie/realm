## structure
Ok, so the idea is to build a framework around which a game can be made. Stories and specific adventures will fall out while building the world, and as characters are developed and explored.

The basic structure is simple: A macguffin is broken into _n_ pieces. When assembled, the path to the final conflict is revealed. 

To support this, the world is also divided into _n_ major regions, each of which protects (or at least contains) one piece.

The adventurers stumble across the first piece, with a clue how to find another one. These first two pieces act as the core introduction to the game and world.

The second one contains clues to several more pieces, and if need be those contain more clues. This branch allows the players to assume responsibility over the direction of the game.

Each major region has at least one major enemy archetype. Typical archetypes, which may or may not be appropriate for the game setting, include:
- pirates
- zombies
- ninjas
- robots
- goblins/kobolds/grubby garbage dweller types
- faeries/naiads/norwegian elves/fantasy
- etc

Each "chapter" consists of entry to the region, discovery of the archetype, exploration and search for the amulet, zero or more mini boss battle(s), full boss battle, a nice reward, and a path or more information about one of the other pieces
